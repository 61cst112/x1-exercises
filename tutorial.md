## Syntax Rules

* Double-slash **//** begins a *comment*.  (The remainder of the line is ignored by compiler.)
* Semicolon **;** must end each statement.
* Each **BLOCK** of statements should be indented and surrounded by *curly-braces*:
````
            {
                        ...
            }
*         

* Blah blah
