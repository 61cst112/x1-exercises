## Syntax Rules
|Character  |       |               |
|:---------:|-------------------|---|
| //        | Double-slash begins a **comment**  |_(Everything else is ignored, until end of line.)          |
| ;         | Semicolon must end each statement. |_(Multiple statements per line are allowed.)_|
| ````{
            ...
}           | +++ | +++ |

| Opening **brace** begins a "block" of statements. | *Code with a **block** should be indented. |
| `         ...`    |  | *All code with a **block** should be indented. |
| }         | Closing **brace** ends a "block" of statements. | *Code with a **block** should be indented. |
